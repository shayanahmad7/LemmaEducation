## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.

### Build

```bash
# Create production build
npm run build

### Waitlist Schema

The homepage waitlist now collects more than just an email address. New signups can store:

- email
- role selection
- custom role / background
- goals or feedback
- willingness to pay

If you are setting up a fresh environment or updating an older database schema, run:

```bash
npm run migrate:waitlist
```

This updates the `public.waitlist_signups` table with the extra waitlist fields used by the local form and API.
